#Take the OSPF LSDB information from a Juniper router and convert it into a Graphviz dot file for visulization.
# if you want to get fancy Omingaffle will take this as input as well.
# Someday I will add more decorations to the node information, like model, serial# and port information. 
# That might happen when I port this to python.
